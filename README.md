# Amadeus

Amadeus is an AI-based extension developed to enhance the users' web browsing experience and to make the browsing task easier and comfortable. The user will have to speak what he desires to do, and it just gets done.It is like a genie from the Arabian Tales. We all have seen in Science fiction movie in which people use the technology through gestures. We tried to provide something similar through this extension. It is suitable for use by anyone whether it's old or young, even the physically handicap could use it. The extension comprises a variety of feature that would assist even a person who feels the use of voice or gestures uninteresting. Text Summarization and Video Summarization will aid to the benefits of the user.

## Features
The main highlight features of the extension:

- **Voice-based Control**: The user can use commands to perform the basic operation of a browser such as open tab, close tab, navigating among tabs, zoom in, zoom out, open URLs, search Wikipedia, bookmark web pages. The user can also use commands to perform the not so basic operations such as clustering and sorting tabs according to their content, change the background color of a web page ( generally for color blind people ) and more.

- **Gesture-based Scrolling**: This feature enables the user to use gesture to scroll through web pages in the web browser. Simple Gesture recognition has been used to identify the gestures that are being fed by the webcam of the Laptops.

- **Text Summarizer**: This feature reduces the time that the user would have to invest on any web page and give the user the jest of the page at the same time. It will summarize the whole content of a website using Lemmatization, PoS tagging, and Parsing which can be carried out in the different linguistic analysis in several languages.
- **Content-Based Sorting**:At times while searching for something on the Internet, we end up opening a huge pile of tabs in a browser , and things get difficult to manage. For that, we have added a feature that will group those tabs according to the content of the pages.
